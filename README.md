# NumPy Repository

## üìå Overview
This repository contains my structured learning journey of NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It includes well-organized Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files covering various NumPy concepts along with cheat sheets in PDF format. This repository is useful for beginners and advanced users who want to master NumPy from basic to advanced topics.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **NumPy Universal Functions (ufuncs)**
This section focuses on built-in mathematical functions in NumPy:

- **Introduction to Universal Functions (ufuncs)**: Understanding the role of ufuncs in NumPy.
- **Creating Custom ufuncs**: Defining and using user-defined universal functions.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Rounding & Decimal Operations**: Controlling precision and rounding numbers.
- **Logarithmic Operations**: Working with log functions.
- **Summations & Products**: Summing and multiplying array elements.
- **Finding Differences**: Calculating differences between elements.
- **Finding LCM & GCD**: Least Common Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Using sine, cosine, tangent, etc.
- **Hyperbolic Functions**: Working with hyperbolic calculations.
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, and difference of NumPy arrays.
